                    <br>
                    After completing master's in computer science, I completed my PhD in computer science from Kent
                    State University, Ohio, USA. During PhD, I taught and developed curriculums for various subjects.
                    After that, I worked as a post-doctoral researcher and curriculum developer at Ryerson University
                    before joining UTSC as a lecturer in Computer Science since Fall 2020. Teaching and developing
                    undergraduate and graduate level courses made me aware of the challenges faced by students and
                    teachers. This experience inspired me to start exploring the world of pedagogy in Computer Science.
                    For research, I am interested in computer science education, database application in health
                    informatics,
                    artificial intelligence, and machine learning.
